# 17. Front-End Engineering & Component Implementation
<!-- id: controls.domain.17 -->

This shard is normative but lazily loaded. Load only the exact capability sections required by the active task or decision. 
Each capability implements five linked controls: **Contract → Procedure → Evidence Gate → Recovery → Regression**. 
A capability is not satisfied by model confidence or a prose assertion; the evidence gate governs completion claims.

## Domain Execution Rule
<!-- id: controls.domain.17.execution -->

For an active capability in this domain:
1. Apply its **Contract** before making a dependent design, routing, implementation, or delivery decision.
2. Follow its **Procedure** in order; later task changes that invalidate inputs require re-evaluation.
3. Do not mark it passed until its **Evidence Gate** is supported by observable evidence.
4. If the gate cannot pass, execute **Recovery** and keep the dependent result provisional or blocked.
5. Use the **Regression** clause when changing BizIQ or evaluating a real-world failure.

## Semantic-component mapping
<!-- id: controls.capability.semantic-component-mapping -->

**Targets:** DESIGN.md / STRUCTURE.md  
**Requirement:** Map design-system components to semantic HTML or platform-native controls before custom behavior is introduced.

### Contract — BQ-0641
<!-- id: control.bq-0641 -->

- **MUST:** Map design-system components to semantic HTML or platform-native controls before custom behavior is introduced.
- Required inputs are the minimum task/project facts on which this decision depends; missing facts must remain explicitly unknown rather than invented.
- Required output is a concrete decision, state, artifact property, or constraint that downstream work can consume.
- Invariants: higher-precedence instructions remain controlling; production intent cannot be silently weakened; fabricated evidence is prohibited.
- Prohibited shortcut: treating an unverified assumption, keyword match, generic template pattern, or model confidence as satisfaction.

### Procedure — BQ-0642
<!-- id: control.bq-0642 -->

1. Determine whether this capability is triggered by the current scope or by a dependency of another active capability.
2. Gather the minimum relevant evidence before selecting a result; distinguish known, inferred, and unknown inputs.
3. Apply the requirement exactly: Map design-system components to semantic HTML or platform-native controls before custom behavior is introduced.
4. Resolve ties using README precedence, business/user goal fit, risk, and the most conservative non-fabricating fallback in that order.
5. Persist the result in the project decision state or artifact evidence ledger when later work depends on it.
6. Re-evaluate when scope, audience, industry, feature set, risk, delivery mode, or evidence materially changes.

### Evidence Gate — BQ-0643
<!-- id: control.bq-0643 -->

- **PASS only if** the requirement is demonstrated by source code, component/state contracts, runtime behavior, automated checks, or fidelity comparisons.
- Evidence must identify what was checked and the observed result. “Looks good,” “should work,” or model confidence alone does not pass.
- If the capability affects a user-visible artifact and rendering/testing tools are available, direct artifact or runtime evidence outranks source-code inference.
- If evidence is unavailable, mark the capability **UNVERIFIED**; do not translate absence of evidence into a pass.

### Recovery — BQ-0644
<!-- id: control.bq-0644 -->

- On failure or insufficient evidence, block any completion claim that depends on this capability.
- Correct the underlying cause when possible, then re-run the procedure and evidence gate.
- When correction is impossible within available tools or facts, use the safest conservative fallback, record the limitation, and preserve unknowns explicitly.
- Never silently skip the control, fabricate supporting facts, or lower the delivery/quality target to make the gate pass.

### Regression — BQ-0645
<!-- id: control.bq-0645 -->

- Maintain or execute three regression conditions: **normal**, **ambiguous/edge**, and **failure/unavailable-evidence**.
- The normal case must produce the intended compliant result; the edge case must invoke deterministic tie-breaking or preserve ambiguity; the failure case must trigger Recovery rather than false completion.
- Any real-world failure involving this capability becomes a regression fixture or a documented reason why a more general fixture covers it.

## Component API discipline

- Required output is a concrete decision, state, artifact property, or constraint that downstream work can consume.
- Invariants: higher-precedence instructions remain controlling; production intent cannot be silently weakened; fabricated evidence is prohibited.
- Prohibited shortcut: treating an unverified assumption, keyword match, generic template pattern, or model confidence as satisfaction.

### Procedure — BQ-0647
<!-- id: control.bq-0647 -->

### Recovery — BQ-0649
<!-- id: control.bq-0649 -->

- On failure or insufficient evidence, block any completion claim that depends on this capability.

## No-dead-control gate
<!-- id: controls.capability.no-dead-control-gate -->

**Targets:** QA_GATES.md  
**Requirement:** Every rendered enabled interactive control must have directly observable intended behavior in its supported states/viewports; otherwise explicitly disable it with a user-visible reason or remove it. Production PASS requires zero unaccounted dead controls.

**Revision 1.7.3 generation prerequisite:** This gate may not be evaluated as PASS when artifact JavaScript has not first passed real syntax parsing and direct runtime-load preflight. A first-frame render with non-executing JavaScript is a blocking implementation failure, not a partially working control state.
